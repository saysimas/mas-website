## Intro to Markdown

When updating the website, you'll be working with Markdown files. There are many editors which you can use for Markdown editing, but I like **Sublime Text** for being lightweight and simple. [You can download Sublime here](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

- **Text Formatting:**   
    You can easily use Markdown to format text in a few different ways.
    To make your text *italicized,* attach one asterisk to each side of the text, like this:
`*really?*`
    To make your text **bold,** attach two asterisks to each side of the text, like this:
`**i'm LOUD!!!**`
    To make your text [a hyperlink](https://crouton.net/), place your text inside of two square brackets, then follow the closing square bracket with parentheses including the link, like this:
`[wow, it's so easy](https://www.crouton.net)`

- **Headings:**  
  Sometimes on a page, you need to have headings to separate out the content. You can easily create headings by adding a pound sign to the start of a new line, like this:
  `# Heading 1 (this one's the biggest one!)`
  `## Heading 2 (this one's a little smaller...)`
  `### Heading 3 (this one's *really* small!)`

- **Quotes:**  
  Creating a separate indentation for quotes is similar to headers. Just add a carat before a  line, like this:
  `>  When the horizon's at the bottom, it's interesting. When the horizon's at the top, it's interesting. When the horizon's in the middle, it's boring as shit.`

- **Lists:** You can easily create two kinds of lists with Markdown.
  - **Unordered lists:** Use hyphens or asterisks, like this:
    ```
    - Eggs
    - Milk
    - Bread
    ```
  - **Ordered lists:** Simply number your items, like this:
  
    ```
    1. Slide to the left
    2. Slide to the right
    3. Cha cha real smooth
    ```

- **Images:**  
  The formatting for inserting an image is similar to the formatting for a hyperlink, but with an exclamation mark in front, like this:
  ``![Picture of two kittens in dresses seated at a table with a tablecloth and a birthday cake](https://www.loc.gov/item/2013648266/)``

- **Horizontal Lines:**  
  To break up content you might want horizontal lines.
    To make a small horizontal line, just type two dashes on a new line, like this: ``--``
To create a large horizontal line that functions like a divider, type three dashes, like this: ``---``
